# Kreato's Userland
The next stage in Kreato Linux.

This organization has the software that will eventually replace a lot of userland components on Kreato Linux.

# Why seperate organization?
Kreato Linux already has a lot of repositories, and i feel like this project is seperate enough to be on a seperate repository.

# Current goals
Have simple but usable software to replace;
* Core utilities
* Init system
