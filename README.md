# Kreato's Userland
This organization has software that will eventually be offered as default on a lot of userland components of Kreato Linux.

The projects on this organization are made to be used within Kreato Linux, but are written in a universal way, so there is nothing stopping anyone else from using projects on this organization.

# Why seperate organization?
Kreato Linux already has a lot of repositories, and i feel like this project is seperate enough to be on a seperate repository.

# Current goals
Have simple but usable software to replace;
* Core utilities
* Maybe Libc (?)
